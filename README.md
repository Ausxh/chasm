# Chasm

A vertical Minecraft PvP map where players are divided into attacking and defending teams.

The distinguishing feature of the map is a large ladder in the center of the map connecting all of the layers of the map, allowing for vertical mobility. There are also side paths that allow players to move between layers.

Both teams start at the bottom of the map, with defenders getting a 1-minute head start. Resources are scattered around the map, so defenders have to choose what paths to obstruct and resources to collect with their head start before heading up to defend the crystal at the top of the map. Can the defenders last for twenty minutes, or will the attackers prevail through cunning or brute force?
